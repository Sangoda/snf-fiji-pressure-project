Pressure Project is a Python script designed to automate the process of monitoring and uploading data from the Fiji machine at SNF (Stanford Nanofabrication Facility) to Google Sheets. This script continuously monitors a specified folder for new data files generated by the Fiji machine, extracts information from the latest 20 runs, formats this data into a table, and uploads it to a designated Google Sheets document. Additionally, the script logs any file additions or deletions in the monitored folder and triggers the data upload process when changes are detected.

The script is created and maintained by Sanya Gowda as part of the Fiji Pressure Project.
Getting Started
Prerequisites

Before using the Pressure Project script, you need to:

    Configure Google API authentication with the provided client secret file.
    Set up the appropriate Google Sheets document where you want the data to be uploaded. You will need the document's title or key for configuration in the script.

Installation

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Install the required Python packages. You can use the following command:

    bash

    pip install pandas matplotlib numpy pygsheets watchdog

Configuration

    Replace the provided client secret file with your Google API authentication credentials in the script.
    Set the appropriate Google Sheets document title or key in the script to specify where the data should be uploaded.

Usage

    Run the script by executing it with Python:

    bash

    python pressure_project.py

    The script will continuously monitor the specified folder for new data files generated by the Fiji machine.
    When changes are detected (file additions or deletions), the script will extract data from the latest 20 data files, create a table with information on recipe names and cycles remaining, and upload the data to the specified Google Sheets document.
    The script also logs file additions and deletions in the monitored folder.

File Structure

    pressure_project.py: The main Python script that monitors the folder, extracts data, and uploads it to Google Sheets.
    data/RF Data: The folder that the script monitors for data files from the Fiji machine.
    cred/client_secret.json: Google API client secret file for authentication.

Dependencies

    pandas
    matplotlib
    numpy
    pygsheets
